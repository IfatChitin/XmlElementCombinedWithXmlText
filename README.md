# XmlElementCombinedWithXmlText
This code shows the differences in xml serialization when a serializable class has a combination of [XmlElement] and [XmlText]

Xml serialization can be done in various ways and techniques. 
In this code I show a difference I experianced with a serializable class declaring a collection as [XmlElement] and a string as [XmlText].
